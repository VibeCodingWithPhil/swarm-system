WORKING INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

1. CHECK EXISTING CODE:
   - Run: ls -la workspace/
   - Review what's already implemented
   - Build upon existing work, don't duplicate

2. IMPLEMENT YOUR TASK:
   - Focus on: Implement testing feature
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow project conventions
   - Create modular, reusable components

3. WRITE TESTS:
   - Create tests in tests/ directory
   - Test all new functionality
   - Run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
   - Ensure tests pass before marking complete

4. UPDATE PROGRESS:
   - Update phase-status.json with your progress (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Mark task as COMPLETED when done
   - Document any blockers or issues

5. COORDINATE:
   - Check what other terminals are doing
   - Avoid conflicts and duplication
   - Share common utilities
   - Maintain consistent coding style

================================================================================
START NOW
================================================================================

Begin by:
1. Check workspace/ for existing code
2. Read your complete todo list at todo/terminal-3.md
3. Implement Implement testing feature with tests
4. Update phase-status.json regularly

Remember: Quality over speed. Write production-ready code with tests.
