## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Always use descriptive commands** - they tell you exactly what they do
2. **Start with `swarm-demo`** to see everything working
3. **Use `swarm-kanban`** in a separate terminal for live monitoring
4. **Use `swarm-go`** to quickly jump between projects
5. **Use templates** like `swarm-new-webapp` for faster setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Command Naming Logic

Every command follows a clear pattern:
- `swarm-new` â†’ Creates something NEW
- `swarm-start` â†’ STARTS the swarm
- `swarm-kanban` â†’ Opens KANBAN board
- `swarm-existing` â†’ Imports EXISTING code
- `swarm-resume` â†’ RESUMES previous work
- `swarm-go` â†’ GO to a project
- `swarm-list` â†’ LIST projects

No more guessing what `sw`, `swk`, or `sws` means!

## ðŸš¦ Quick Start Checklist

1. âœ… Run `swarm-setup` to install commands
2. âœ… Run `source ~/.bashrc` to activate
3. âœ… Run `swarm-help` to see all commands
4. âœ… Run `swarm-demo` to test everything
